            <p>George Harvey Strait Sr. (born May 18, 1952) is an American country music
              singer, songwriter, actor, and music producer. Strait is credited for pioneering the neotraditional
              country style in the 1980s, famed for his authentic cowboy image and roots-oriented sound at a time
              when
              the Nashville music industry was dominated by country pop crossover acts. Given his influence on the
              genre, Strait has been named the <em>"King of Country Music"</em> by writers and music critics.
              Strait
              currently holds the record for most number one songs on all charts by an artist, in any genre of
              music."
