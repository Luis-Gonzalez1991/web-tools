      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>George Harvey Strait Sr. was born on May 18, 1952, in Poteet, Texas, to John Byron Strait Sr.
          (January 11, 1922 – June 4, 2013), and Doris Jean Couser (June 26, 1930 – January 30, 2010).
          He grew up in nearby Pearsall, in Frio County,[1] where his father was a junior high school
          mathematics teacher and the owner of a 2,000-acre (810 ha) cattle ranch outside of Big Wells, Texas.
          The family worked at the ranch on the weekends and in the summers. When George was in the fourth
          grade, his father and mother were divorced, and his mother moved away with his sister, Pency. George
          and his brother John "Buddy" Jr. (1950–2009), were raised by their father. For most of his early
          life, Strait spent his time ranching alongside his older brother Buddy and his father John</p>
        <h3>High School</h3>
        <p>Strait began his musical career while attending Pearsall High School, where he performed in a rock
          and
          roll garage band, known as the Stoics, taking most influence and inspiration from the Beatles and
          other
          British Invasion-era rock groups. "The Beatles were big," Strait confirmed. "I listened to them a
          lot
          and that whole bunch of groups that were popular then." Strait would perform in other rock bands
          during
          his high school tenure.</p>

      <h2>Career</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Discography</h3>
        <p>In more than 30 years of recording, all of which have been spent with MCA Records, George Strait has
          garnered 61 number-one songs on all country charts (including Mediabase 24/7, the former Radio &
          Records chart, and the now-defunct Gavin Report chart), and has more number-one hits than any other
          artist in a single genre. His 44 Billboard country number-one hits are a record, four more than
          Conway Twitty's total that includes several duets with Loretta Lynn.</p>
        <p>
          Additionally, <mark>Strait is also the first artist in the history of Billboard to have at least one
            single enter the top 10 of a Billboard chart for 30 consecutive years</mark>, starting in 1981
          when his debut single "Unwound" peaked at number six on the Hot Country Singles chart. All of his
          top-10 singles have been on that chart. Strait has sold more than 68 million records in the United
          States alone, and his certifications from the RIAA include 13 multiplatinum, 33 platinum, and 38
          gold albums.

        <h3>Filmography</h3>
        <p>Strait has acted in several films. He had a bit part in The Soldier (1982) and starred in Pure
          Country (1992). He also appeared as himself in Grand Champion (2002). The film Pure Country featured
          George Strait in the lead role as Dusty Chandler, a famous country singer who strays too far from
          his country roots and traditional sound. It provided the opportunity for Strait to branch out from
          his own traditional country sound for a more rock-and-roll approach. The film had little success at
          the box office and took in only $15 million, but the soundtrack also called Pure Country, produced
          several hit singles for Strait. It has become his best-selling album to date. Strait had a limited
          role in the sequel to Pure Country, Pure Country 2: The Gift.</p>
