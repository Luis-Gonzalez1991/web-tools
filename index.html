          <p>George Harvey Strait Sr. (born May 18, 1952) is an American country music
            singer, songwriter, actor, and music producer. Strait is credited for pioneering the neotraditional
            country style in the 1980s, famed for his authentic cowboy image and roots-oriented sound at a time
            when
            the Nashville music industry was dominated by country pop crossover acts. Given his influence on the
            genre, Strait has been named the <em>"King of Country Music"</em> by writers and music critics.
            Strait
            currently holds the record for most number one songs on all charts by an artist, in any genre of
            music."
          </p>

          <p>
            Strait has sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music
            artists of all time. He holds the RIAA record for most certified platinum albums by any artist, with
            33 certified platinum albums. Strait also has 13 multi-platinum and 38 gold albums. His best-selling
            album is Pure Country (1992), which sold 6 million (6× platinum). His highest certified album is
            Strait Out of the Box (1995), which sold 2 million copies (8× Platinum due to being a box set with
            four CDs). According to the RIAA, Strait is the 12th best-selling album recording artist in the
            United States overall selling over <strong>69 million records</strong> across the United States.

          <p>George Harvey Strait Sr. was born on May 18, 1952, in Poteet, Texas, to John Byron Strait Sr.
            (January 11, 1922 – June 4, 2013), and Doris Jean Couser (June 26, 1930 – January 30, 2010).
            He grew up in nearby Pearsall, in Frio County,[1] where his father was a junior high school
            mathematics teacher and the owner of a 2,000-acre (810 ha) cattle ranch outside of Big Wells, Texas.
            The family worked at the ranch on the weekends and in the summers. When George was in the fourth
            grade, his father and mother were divorced, and his mother moved away with his sister, Pency. George
            and his brother John "Buddy" Jr. (1950–2009), were raised by their father. For most of his early
            life, Strait spent his time ranching alongside his older brother Buddy and his father John</p>
          <h3 class="left-title">High School</h3>
          <p>Strait began his musical career while attending Pearsall High School, where he performed in a rock
            and
            roll garage band, known as the Stoics, taking most influence and inspiration from the Beatles and
            other
            British Invasion-era rock groups. "The Beatles were big," Strait confirmed. "I listened to them a
            lot
            and that whole bunch of groups that were popular then." Strait would perform in other rock bands
            during
            his high school tenure.</p>

          <p>In more than 30 years of recording, all of which have been spent with MCA Records, George Strait has
            garnered 61 number-one songs on all country charts (including Mediabase 24/7, the former Radio &
            Records chart, and the now-defunct Gavin Report chart), and has more number-one hits than any other
            artist in a single genre. His 44 Billboard country number-one hits are a record, four more than
            Conway Twitty's total that includes several duets with Loretta Lynn.</p>
          <p>
            Additionally, <mark>Strait is also the first artist in the history of Billboard to have at least one
              single enter the top 10 of a Billboard chart for 30 consecutive years</mark>, starting in 1981
            when his debut single "Unwound" peaked at number six on the Hot Country Singles chart. All of his
            top-10 singles have been on that chart. Strait has sold more than 68 million records in the United
            States alone, and his certifications from the RIAA include 13 multiplatinum, 33 platinum, and 38
            gold albums.

          <h3 class="right-title">Filmography</h3>
          <p>Strait has acted in several films. He had a bit part in The Soldier (1982) and starred in Pure
            Country (1992). He also appeared as himself in Grand Champion (2002). The film Pure Country featured
            George Strait in the lead role as Dusty Chandler, a famous country singer who strays too far from
            his country roots and traditional sound. It provided the opportunity for Strait to branch out from
            his own traditional country sound for a more rock-and-roll approach. The film had little success at
            the box office and took in only $15 million, but the soundtrack also called Pure Country, produced
            several hit singles for Strait. It has become his best-selling album to date. Strait had a limited
            role in the sequel to Pure Country, Pure Country 2: The Gift.</p>
