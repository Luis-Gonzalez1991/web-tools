                <h3 class="left-title">Luis Gonzalez</h3>
                <p> Luis is a 33 year old Hispanic man that decided to go back to school to learn Cloud Computing. When he was in high school he learned basic web development, as well as other computer related topics, that lead to his eventual interest in the subject. About half way through the degree, Luis remembered how fun web development is and decided to pursue a web developer certificate for completion after his associate's degree. Before starting the certificate, he learned a some of the basics by going through the first section of <em>The Odin Project</em>, an online web development class.
                </p>

                <P>The first class Luis took that is dedicated to web development is <em>Web Design Tools</em>. In this class he learned some of the basics of VS Code. Though he was already familiar with VS Code because of his prior experience, it was easy to pick up, but Luis found that the class helped him fill in some important gaps in his knowledge about the IDE. Such as its integration with GIT. Luis also learned the basis of HTML and CSS. Using these to make a simple web page that would eventually evolve into a full suite of pages that includes a form and a page dedicated to some AI created employees' profiles. Thumbnails of pictures that lead to the full size copy of the image were included. CSS was added to add visual appeal as well as a structure to separate important parts of the page, such as the nav, table of contents, and footer.</P>

                <p>Unfortunately, Luis' work hours picked up tremendously due to the season being busier than expected in his line of work. This did not stop him from completing his tasks, although sometimes late. What this did, though, was cause a time crunch that prevented Luis from really honing his skills and creating the website he would really like to make. Perhaps in the future he will have more time to correct the mistakes he made in order to create a more appealing website!</p>
